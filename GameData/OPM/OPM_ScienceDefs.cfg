		HaleSrfLandedLightRock = This surface consists of a grainy, very fine, sand-like dust. It appears to be getting everywhere.
		HaleSrfLandedDarkRock = The soil sample is one of the darkest colored things you have ever encountered in your life.
		
		OvokSrfLandedDarkSurface = The ground materials appear to be a combination of basaltic rocks and breccia.
		OvokSrfLandedPlains = Mission Control warns you not to make the surface samples into snowballs.
		OvokSrfLandedScarring = You want to make the surface sample into a snowball. Sadly, you can't find a worthy target.
		
		SlateSrfLandedSlateanSupercontinent = Years of training has brought Kerbalkind here, to find this handful of dust! You hope you won't be fired for that.
		SlateSrfLandedYahelMountains = Here the surface is mostly dirt and rocks. You're very confident that if you looked under the dirt, you'd find more dirt and rocks.
		SlateSrfLandedSomborMountains = The climate is frigid, and the ground is impenetrable.
		SlateSrfLandedImpactCraters = This area has a particularly high concentration of rare elements. Nice!
		SlateSrfLandedSeabed = The soil sample contains traces of salt. You wonder if it has blown here or if the area was once underwater.
		SlateSrfLandedNorthernIslands = The soil here is surprisingly soft, like Play-Koh.
		SlateSrfLandedArchipelagos = The soil reminds you of the sand on Kerbin’s beaches, but it’s less dense and darker in color.
		SlateSrfLandedMountNehelennia = The rocks are hot and slightly molten. You decide it's best not to dig any deeper.
		SlateSrfLandedFloodplains = The rocks here are a mixture of sand and gravel. There are signs that a river used to be nearby.
		SlateSrfLandedPoles = You take a sample of the "ice". Its texture is brittle with watery attributes. There might have been water here.
		
		TektoSrfSplashedLakes = The lakes seem to consist of liquid ethane, a substance generally only found in gaseous form on Kerbin.
		TektoSrfLandedMudflats = Your boots are so covered in the wet mud that you can just scrape it off back in the spacecraft to obtain a sample.
		TektoSrfLandedCalderas = The sample resembles ash, indicating that this place used to have volcanic activity.
		TektoSrfLandedOutcrops = This sample of exposed bedrock will tell the scientists back home a great deal about Tekto's history.
		TektoSrfLandedPlateaus = This unusual green soil definitely needs to be investigated thoroughly.
		TektoSrfLandedStrands = The sample you picked up mostly consists of multi-colored sand.
		TektoSrfLandedSlopes = You pick up a loose rock off the inclined slope and wonder how far it tumbled down.
		TektoSrfLandedGeologicalAnomaly = The soil seems to be of an unusual orange color. Something doesn't feel right about this place.

		PoltaSrfLandedLowlands = Mixed in with the rock is water ice, which contains trace amounts of carbon dioxide and methane. Interesting!
		PoltaSrfLandedLowlands = You stare up at the stars, wondering, why you are here on this rock. Then you realize you're here to drill, baby!
		PoltaSrfLandedMidlands = This sample remind you of Minmus. You theorize that this moon is actually a clone of Minmus!
		PoltaSrfLandedHighlands = The sample resembles ice cream. You have to fight every fiber in your body to not take of your helmet and lick the sample.
		PoltaSrfLandedHighlands = The place looks like Minmus. You start to wonder what dessert it tastes like.
		PoltaSrfLandedHighlandDepressions = You find traces of elements found nowhere else nearby. No doubt most of these depressions were caused by asteroid impacts, even if the crater is no longer clearly visible.
		PriaxSrfLandedLeadingSide = The regolith sample is very fine-grained, no doubt a result of constant impacts with asteroids coming across Priax' orbital path.
		PriaxSrfLandedLeadingSide = You were expecting rock, but got mostly ice. Another day, another disappointment.
		PriaxSrfLandedLeadingCraters = The material from this crater is lighter than other parts of the moon because it has not yet been darkened by centuries of bombardment by solar rays, indicating the crater is relatively recent.
		PriaxSrfLandedLeadingCraters = The ammonia crystals feel crunchy as you pick them up. 	
		PriaxSrfLandedTrailingSide = This moon is most certainly not made of cheese. After Minmus and now this, you are uncertain as to whether any snacks can be found on other worlds.

		PriaxSrfLandedTrailingCraters = The material here is very cheesy-looking, indicating that the tidal forces coming from Polta are having some effect of the surface even here.
		WalSrfLandedEquatorialRidge = What? It's not made of walnuts?
		WalSrfLandedEquatorialRidge = The darker surface here is of a different composition than the rest of the moon. Perhaps these broken rocks are pieces of a larger moon that once collided with Wal. You make a note to compare these samples with those from Tal.
		WalSrfLandedMidlands = You try to eat the sample, but you remember that removing your helmet would be bad.
		WalSrfLandedMidlands = The color of the sample reminds you of your favorite childhood dessert.
		WalSrfLandedHighlands = The rock sample from the highlands seems to be anorthositic in composition. This seems to indicate that the highlands are older than the lower parts of the moon.
		WalSrfLandedEquatorialCraters = You try to squeeze the sample to make it look like a walnut.
		WalSrfLandedEquatorialCraters = A thick smell of sulfur seeps through the cabin. You know that Wal is made of sulfur, and you start to wonder who built this thing...
		WalSrfLandedPolarCraters = You are disappointed: you expected to pick up some snow, as you are at the pole...
		
		TalSrfLandedSurface = The sample looks yummy. You start to wonder if there's any chocolate on the ship.
		TalSrfLandedImpactBasin = The ice is thinner here.
		TalSrfLandedSurface = Looks rocky. And icy.
		TalSrfLandedImpactBasin = Doesn't really look that different.
		
		ThatmoSrfLandedPoles = The sample is slightly more icy than the others.
		ThatmoSrfLandedHills = Ice, ice, baby!
		ThatmoSrfLandedHills = The samples show evidence of recent cryovolcanic activity. This makes you slightly nervous, but not enough to stop admiring the landscape.
		ThatmoSrfLandedHighlands = The ice looks good enough to sled on.

		ThatmoSrfLandedCantaloupeTerrain = You were expecting the sample to be juicier.
		ThatmoSrfLandedMidlands = Various minerals in the ice here have tinted the sample all sorts of pale colors.
		ThatmoSrfLandedCanyons = The sample is mostly ice, though the ice seems a little less dense in this area.
		ThatmoSrfLandedCanyons = The sample contains traces of organic materials!
		NisseeSrfLandedMaximusCrater = The ice here seems to have been crushed when the Maximus Crater was formed. Wait, what? Crushed ice!
		NisseeSrfLandedCompanionCraters = The samples seem very friendly. Almost too friendly.
		NisseeSrfLandedAncientCraters = Any evidence of an impact, based on the appearance of the samples, is gone.
		NisseeSrfLandedYoungCraters = Aww, baby craters!
		NisseeSrfLandedYoungCraters = The samples look like a slushie.
		NisseeSrfLandedPoles = And you thought regular dirty ice was cold...
		NisseeSrfLandedFlats = 	This may be the flattest sample you've ever collected.

		HaleSrfLandedLightRock = You feel that the spacecraft would have been better off with grappling hooks than landing legs.
		HaleSrfLandedDarkRock = Is the spacecraft's shadow causing those dark patches?
		
		OvokSrfLandedDarkSurface = The spacecraft seems steady here.
		OvokSrfLandedPlains = You can feel the spacecraft starting to sink into the ground and start to wonder if it's best to stay here long.
		OvokSrfLandedScarring = This position give you a slightly better view of the relative flatness of the moon.

		SlateSrfLandedArchipelagos = Perhaps this archipelago is all that remains of a once luscious tropical region?
		SlateSrfLandedMountNehelennia = The ground seems to shift beneath the ship. Sensors tell you that at any moment the volcano could spew forth vicious lava. Perhaps it isn't a good idea to stick around.
		SlateSrfLandedFloodplains = This would've been a dangerous place to live when this world was still alive.
		SlateSrfLandedPoles = You look out the windows and see ice. Lots and lots of ice. And some rocks here and there. Icy rocks.
		
		TektoSrfSplashedLakes = You hope the craft is hermetically sealed. Who knows that this strange liquid will do to the electronics.
		TektoSrfLandedMudflats = The craft seems stable...for now.

		TektoFlyingLowPlateaus = That is the flattest terrain around here.
		TektoFlyingLowStrands = Maybe I can work on a tan down there.
		TektoFlyingLowSlopes = Those slopes look too steep to land on. Then again, a challenge is a challenge.

		TektoInSpaceHigh = Well, it's, er... It's green.
		
		PoltaSrfLandedLowlands = You record your observations in your Mun log before realizing you're on Polta. Rather than copy them, you simply scratch out "Mun" on the logbook's cover.
		PoltaSrfLandedMidlands = The surface shifts slightly under your craft as it settles onto Polta's surface. You close your eyes and think of Kerbin.
		PoltaSrfLandedHighlands = An argument breaks out with Mission Control about precisely the shade of dirty green the ground here has.
		PoltaSrfLandedHighlandDepressions = Most of the depressions seem to be craters, but they are extensively worn, perhaps by the effects of Urlum on the moon.
		PriaxSrfLandedLeadingSide = Though it appeared rocky from orbit, the surface crunches under your ship like ice.
		PriaxSrfLandedLeadingCraters = From here, the leading craters probably look a lot like the trailing craters.

		WalSrfLandedEquatorialRidge = You can see so far away from up this ridge!
		WalSrfLandedEquatorialRidge = It's amazing how tall this ridge is. It completely dwarfs the highest mountains on Kerbin!
		WalSrfLandedMidlands = When you look through the window, you immediately ask Mission Control to send you walnuts.
		WalSrfLandedMidlands = You can't help but crack the joke of going nuts here. Mission control is not amused.
		WalSrfLandedHighlands = You suddenly realize that Wal has highlands and midlands, but no lowlands. After double-checking your maps, you record them as "missing".
		WalSrfLandedHighlands = You wonder if the highlands are jealous because they'll never be as high as the ridge.
		WalSrfLandedEquatorialCraters = The ridge is visible from here. It towers over everything on the moon.
		WalSrfLandedPolarCraters = You are at a pole! You hope to see walnut Santa knocking at the ship's door!
			
		PoltaInSpaceLow = If Polta is green, and Priax is cheese, perhaps they came from an earlier moon made of green cheese?  You log the theory as "plausible".
		PriaxInSpaceLow = At first glance, Polta and Priax don't make any sense. Everyone knows mint doesn't go with cheese.

		NisseeSrfLandedMaximusCrater = It wasn't a trick of the light, Maximus Crater really IS that big.
		NisseeSrfLandedCompanionCraters = The crater gives you a friendly smile. Wait a minute, craters don't smile!

		NisseeSrfLandedFlats = You spend five minutes trying to describe the terrain, only to write "flat" in your log. Suddenly sending you all the way out here doesn't seem worth it.			
		ThatmoFlyingLowPoles = You forget that there is an atmosphere here.
		ThatmoFlyingLowHills = It would be easier to admire these majestic hills if you weren't so busy avoiding crashing into them.
		ThatmoFlyingLowHighlands = You feel like you should go higher.
		ThatmoFlyingLowCantaloupeTerrain = Cantaloupe! Wait, was I supposed to write a crew report? I was? Oh, the terrain looks really bumpy. 
		ThatmoFlyingLowMidlands = You make a note of how impossible aerodynamic flight is here.
		ThatmoFlyingLowCanyons = You consider making an obvious movie reference, but then you remember that Kerbal engineers haven't invented movies yet. Maybe you should research them before your next multi-year space trek.
		ThatmoFlyingHigh = You do a barrel roll, then realize it wasn't nearly as exciting as you thought it would be with such little atmosphere.			
		ThatmoInSpaceLow = You start counting bands in Neidon's atmosphere.

		PoltaSrfLandedMidlands = Some swirling terrain in the transition between the highlands and lowlands make you curious about the role of Urlum's tidal heating of Polta.
		PoltaSrfLandedMidlands = You dig up some of the surface with an ice scoop. When you realize your helmet prevents you from eating it, you start to look for a worthy target...
		PoltaSrfLandedHighlands = You briefly think the ground is a mirror and your eyes have disappeared before realizing the surface is green.
		PoltaSrfLandedHighlands = You don't know why, but the Polka is so much more fun on Polta.
		PoltaSrfLandedHighlandDepressions = Most of the depressions seem to be craters, but they are extensively worn, perhaps by the effects of Urlum on the moon.
		PriaxSrfLandedLeadingSide = With Polta hovering above, it seems obvious that the weathering on this side of Priax is caused by material thrown off from its larger brother.
		PriaxSrfLandedLeadingCraters = A fine green film on the ground here suggests the craters were caused by large debris thrown off by Polta.
		PriaxSrfLandedTrailingSide = Where did all these craters come from?  Is it possible Priax wasn't always tidally locked to Polta?
		PriaxSrfLandedTrailingCraters = The tall crater walls contribute to a growing feeling of claustrophobia.
		WalSrfLandedEquatorialRidge = What a nice view!
		WalSrfLandedEquatorialRidge = Standing here, even you must conclude that Tal has something to do with this ridge.

		WalSrfLandedPolarCraters = You radio Mission Control, asking them why you are even here.
			
		PoltaInSpaceLowLowlands = The dark gray surface below suggests Polta has been heavily weathered.
		PoltaInSpaceLowMidlands = "You've seen one gray surface from low orbit, millions of kilometers from home, you've seen 'em all," you think.  Maybe you've been at this for too long.
		PoltaInSpaceLowHighlands = The high albedo of the minty green surface below suggests it is mostly dirty ice.  Probably not as tasty as it looks.
		PoltaInSpaceLowHighlandDepressions = From here, you can see that the depressions have been weathered, suggesting the impacts that caused them were ancient.
		PriaxInSpaceLowLeadingSide = The lightness of Priax's leading side suggests that impacts are ongoing, and you worry about micrometeorites coming from Polta.
		PriaxInSpaceLowLeadingCraters = The sharp edges of the craters are unusual.  How have they survived the weathering of the rest of the leading side?
		PriaxInSpaceLowTrailingSide = You're floating in a most peculiar way, but Priax looks pretty much the same today.
		PriaxInSpaceLowTrailingCraters = You wonder about the number and depth of craters on the trailing side; any strikes would be from asteroids with very unusual orbits.
